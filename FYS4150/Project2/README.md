# Project 2: Eigenvalue problems: Buckling beam and the Schr√∂dinger equation

Inside the folder Compfys_functions are the implementations of Jacobi method, Lanczos' method and the Bisection method for solving eigenvalue problems. 
The file Jacobi_Bisec_Lanczos_buckling.py solves for the Buckling beam eigenvalues, and gives Figure 1-8
